### Success Criteria
The project will be considered successful if the team creates a fully functional, pet-themed e-commerce website that is secure and responsive, as well as an enjoyable learning experience for the team to build developmental, managerial, and collaborative skills.

### Constraints
**Timeframe:** The timeframe for the project is one semester, which limits how many features can be implemented and tested.
**Hosting:** Hosting through Azure may change depending on the needs of the application.
**Learning Curve:** The team is new to some of the chosen technologies in the chosen tech stack, which may slow progress due to additional research requirements.
**Team Collaboration:** Uneven workload or misalignment may impact progress.
