## Project Goals
*Pawsitive Match* will be a fully functional e-commerce styled website that allows users to sign in, adopt a pet, and track the pet adoption information within the selected userâ€™s profile. *Pawsitive Match* will also include documentation that outlines the system requirements, architecture, design models, diagrams, testing approach, and team responsibilities. 

### Success Criteria
The project will be considered successful if the team creates a fully functional, pet-themed e-commerce website that is secure and responsive, as well as an enjoyable learning experience for the team to build developmental, managerial, and collaborative skills.

### Constraints
**Timeframe:** The timeframe for the project is one semester, which limits how many features can be implemented and tested.

**Hosting:** Hosting through Azure may change depending on the needs of the application.

**Learning Curve:** The team is new to some of the chosen technologies in the chosen tech stack, which may slow progress due to additional research requirements.

**Team Collaboration:** Uneven workload or misalignment may impact progress.

## Deliverables
**First Phase**
- Create a Project Proposal that gives a clear outline of the Pawsitive Match website.
- Identify the tools, communication plans, and build expectations for each week.
- Provides team with estimation for project goals and timeline.

**Second Phase**
- Give an overall Progress Report over what we have managed to accomplish.
- Showcase the implementation progress and how our system was designed.
- Mainly used for feedback from customers, shareholders, and for reference by the team.

**Third Phase**
